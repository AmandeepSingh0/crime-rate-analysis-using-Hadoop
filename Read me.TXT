Data was collected from https://data.cityofchicago.org/PublicSafety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2(2017 Dataset Crime). 
Data was pre-processed and cleaned to remove missing values and garbage values at various positions. Then, it was given as input to our
code in mapper code. 
The output from mapper was sent to reducer code and the corresponding results were printed. 
The results were saved in a text file as the code was run in Hadoop. The part of code was then selected and pasted in excel file. 
Corresponding graphs were created to display the results more beautifully.
